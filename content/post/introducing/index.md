## About CTCW

CTCW is a resource for assessing the climate target setting of companies. When a company sets targets for its future emissions, we want to know if that has an effect on their behaviour as measured by various indicators. There is a lot of context required to consider whether a company's target setting behaviour has it on course for climate impact mitigation success - CTCW aims to bring it together in one place.

Presently we have the first sets of targets being published by many companies, and only a few years worth of data to assess the trend in their emissions, but over time this picture will become more complicated as fresh targets are published and more longitudinal data is available.

The impetus for CTCW is to produce a dynamic "one-pager" showing all of the most relevant target and metric data in a few relatively easily consumed graphs which allow the reader to quickly get up to speed on a company's target-related behaviour.
