This post introduces the company overview of Unilever, one of the first companies to be analysed. It begins with a standard set of graphs that can be found on the company [overview pages](/companies/overviews/) of any company featured on CTCW.

# Climate Targets

Unilever has published a number of targets related to carbon emissions. In the first plot we can see that they set a target of Net Zero emissions (where any emissions are offset by carbon capture or storage projects) by 2039 with a reference year of 2019. The target was published in 2021, and so far there has been no fresh data.

This target was rated as Low on Integrity by the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor, meaning ...

Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor rated this target as Moderate on Transparency, because ...

The second graph shows a more ambitious target for elimination of Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, which Unilever is on target to meet. It looks like they are making good progress on this target.

It is important to bear in mind the relative importance of different types of emission for the organisation.

Scope 3 emissions account for by far the largest share of Unilever's emissions.

In considering how a company is reducing its reported emissions, there are some useful graphs which can usually be constructed from available public data.

One such graph (below) considers the type of energy being used by the company (critical for scope 1 emissions in particular).

{{< figure src="Unilever-energy-renewable.png" >}}

We can see from this graph that Unilever has been increasing its proportion of renewable energy, but not all forms of renewable energy are considered equal in the fight against climate change. The graph below explores the percentage of energy use which is coming from different sources, for renewables only.

The most beneficial uses of renewable energy are tied to specific locations where the company's demand incentivises greater generation of green energy - this could either be green energy produced on-site (which Unilever uses a negligible amount of) or Bundled RECs (Renewable Energy Certificates). Unbundled RECs are not tied to the company's operating areas so considered less beneficial. Unilever has been making increasing use of renewable energy which is purchased with unbundled RECs or no RECs at all, which could be considered as a shortcut to improving their GHG emissions that doesn't have much external impact.

Another interesting question we can ask is how the company plans to reduce its emissions, whether reducing the intensity or scale of production processes or by doing some form of offsetting. Cutting raw emissions is treated as more significant than offsetting by the groups who evaluate these targets, and where offsetting is being used this should be rigorously tested for effectiveness. Tracking the raw reductions and contributions of various types of offsetting on the road to "Net Zero" will be a useful graph, but the available data from companies would make it very sparse at this moment in 2022. {Coming soon}

We may also wish to consider a company's targets in light of other behavioural aspects, such as fines for environmental breaches as in the graph below.
