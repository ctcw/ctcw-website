CTCW is open for contributions in a number of ways. You can join **my active project** on WikiRate to help collecting and checking data which can be used to generate more company overviews.

CTCW itself is an open source static website hosted on GitHub, contributions can be made directly as Pull Requests but please discuss it with me before putting significant work into anything other than fleshing out company overviews.
