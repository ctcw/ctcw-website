# Climate Targets
AP Moller - Maersk has published a number of targets related to carbon emissions. In the first plot we can see that they set a target of Net Zero emissions (where any emissions are offset by carbon capture or storage projects) by 2040 with a reference year of 2019. The target was published in 2021. This target was rated Reasonable on Transparency, assessing the level of disclosure for past/present emissions and the level of detail provided about planning to achieve target aims. This target was rated Reasonable on Integrity, an assessment of the target's ambition and appropriateness. 
In these graphs the dashed line represents the target's publication date, the target line starts from the reference year.

There is an issue with the above graph because not all of the data has been entered for the reference year - Maersk did not publish scope 3 emissions data for 2019, so it is their "fault", but in practice the issue likely stems from inconsistency in how data is labelled by Maersk for reporting and target-setting purposes.

You can see here that Scope 1 and 3 account for most of Maersk's emissions, Scope 2 is of relatively minor concern. Maersk do however provide both market-based and location-based estimates for scope 2, which is good practice. In this case is makes little practical difference which estimation methodology is used.
