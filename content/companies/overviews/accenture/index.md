# Climate Targets

Accenture has published a number of targets related to carbon emissions. In the first plot we can see that they set a target of Net Zero emissions (where any emissions are offset by carbon capture or storage projects) by 2025 with a reference year of 2016. The target was published in 2020. This target was rated Reasonable on Transparency, assessing the level of disclosure for past/present emissions and the level of detail provided about planning to achieve target aims. This target was rated Very Low on Integrity, an assessment of the target's ambition and appropriateness.

The second graph shows the absolute emission reduction target of 11% by 2025, indicating that the remaining 89% of emissions Accenture is responsible for will continue but be offset, and they're using nature based offsetting which has issues of permanence.

This graph also suggests a closer look at the year labelling of data, because the narrative provided by Corporate Climate Responsibilty Monitor suggests that the reduction targets are based on the highest year of emissions, which would be the subsequent year. This is likely a common issue with labelling according to Financial Year or calendar year in which emissions took place.

It looks like Scope 1 and 2 reporting started much earlier than Scope 3, and that 1 and 2 have already seen significant reductions.
