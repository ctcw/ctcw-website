# Climate Targets

Amazon has published a number of targets related to carbon emissions. In the first plot we can see that they set a target of Net Zero emissions (where any emissions are offset by carbon capture or storage projects) by 2040 with a reference year of 2019. The target was published in 2019. This target was rated Low on Transparency, assessing the level of disclosure for past/present emissions and the level of detail provided about planning to achieve target aims. This target was rated Low on Integrity, an assessment of the target's ambition and appropriateness. In these graphs the dashed line represents the target's publication date, the target line starts from the reference year.

One of the criticisms of Amazon's targets is that they provide very little detail about how they plan to get to net zero or what it means to them, hence the Low transparency rating. They don't make any targets for pure emission cuts, so the graph that would usually come second is not useful here.

The first graph shows that Amazon's emissions are huge and growing. Looking at the scope of emissions in the second graph below, Scope 3 has shown the greatest growth by some distance, while Scope 2 emissions have been greatly reduced. **I haven't checked the 2018 data so that needs a look, it comes from a different source.**

Another note, not reflected on a graph yet because it's the first one I have seen, but Amazon does not include subsidiaries in its figures. There is also a lack of detailed figures on renewable energy use or where that is coming from.

*Look at bringing in the revenue or volume data, they're publishing improvements in carbon efficiency.*
