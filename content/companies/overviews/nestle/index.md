# Climate Targets
Nestle has published a number of targets related to carbon emissions. In the first plot we can see that they set a target of Net Zero emissions (where any emissions are offset by carbon capture or storage projects) by 2050 with a reference year of 2019. The target was published in 2020. This target was rated Very Low on Transparency, assessing the level of disclosure for past/present emissions and the level of detail provided about planning to achieve target aims. This target was rated Very Low on Integrity, an assessment of the target's ambition and appropriateness.

In these graphs the dashed line represents the target's publication date, the target line starts from the reference year.

Nestle's targets were rated Very Poor by Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor because there is a lack of detail and cohesion around the targets and reporting, different targets appear in different places without and although they aren't directly contradictory there is no clear logic uniting them and the way they are described leaves much to the imagination.

In addition to the hopelessly vague net zero by 2050 target Nestle has provided two short term targets implying a steepening drop in emissions after 2025, but have said very little about what will change in their approach to bring about the uptick in transition speed.

This graph shows how dominant scope 3 emissions are in Nestle's impact, and some of these (such as emissions from the use of sold products) have been excluded from the scope of Nestle's targets. There is also ambiguity about the company's position on offsetting, with the head office saying it does not play a role in their plans but individual brands being encouraged to use offsetting to gain "carbon neutral" status for their products.
