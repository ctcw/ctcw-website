# Climate Targets

Apple Inc. has published a number of targets related to carbon emissions. In the first plot we can see that they set a target of Net Zero emissions (where any emissions are offset by carbon capture or storage projects) by 2030 with a reference year of 2020. The target was published in 2020. This target was rated Reasonable on Transparency, assessing the level of disclosure for past/present emissions and the level of detail provided about planning to achieve target aims. This target was rated Moderate on Integrity, an assessment of the target's ambition and appropriateness.

In these graphs the dashed line represents the target's publication date, the target line starts from the reference year.

Apple also set a target for cutting absolute emissions of 62% by 2030 with a 2019 baseline.

Apple has been claiming carbon neutrality "as a company" for a while, and this is based on limiting its Scope 1 + 2 emissions to very low figures through the use of renewable energy, with remaining emissions then offset.

You can see from this graph that Apple didn't start reporting Scope 3 emissions until 2017, and that these are orders of magnitude greater than the Scope 1 and 2 emissions which have been successfully reduced.
