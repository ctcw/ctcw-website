# Climate Targets

Google Inc. has published a number of targets related to carbon emissions. In the first plot we can see that they set a target of Net Zero emissions (where any emissions are offset by carbon capture or storage projects) by 2030 with a reference year of 2020. The target was published in 2020. This target was rated Low on Transparency, assessing the level of disclosure for past/present emissions and the level of detail provided about planning to achieve target aims. This target was rated Low on Integrity, an assessment of the target's ambition and appropriateness.

In these graphs the dashed line represents the target's publication date, the target line starts from the reference year.

Google did not set any interim targets or targets for reduction of absolute emissions, instead claiming that they have been "carbon neutral" since 2007, but it transpires that major scope 3 emission sources accounting for 60% of Google's overall emissions were excluded from the basis of this claim. Lack of clarity around terms and no detail about Scope 3 emissions beyond a single number for "business reasons" are some of the reasons Google's targets were rated low on Transparency. Their reporting also does not cover Alphabet Inc. subsidiaries. The final interpretation after an update from Google in 2021 is that for scope 1 and 2 emissions they will be "carbon free" by 2030, whereas when considering Scope 3 they aspire to "net zero" emissions by 2030.

Google is however providing 4 years of reporting for some data that can provide insight into the nature of their carbon emissions and efforts to change.

According to this overview most of Google's emissions are Scope 3, however the estimates generated using "location based" methods are multiple times greater. At least Google publishes these locaiton based estimates, although almost always makes reference to the lower market based figures.

Google also publishes a breakdown of renewable energy sourcing and carbon offsets, which are explored in the next two graphs.

The first impression is that Google's energy use is continuously growing, its Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and on site generation have been growing but not quickly enough to satisfy their demand, so renewable energy purchased from the grid has been growing too. It is regarded as preferable for large companies to get their energy directly from renewable sources which they have been instrumental in developing, buying it from the grid does little to increase capacity and can deprive other users.

Google provide a 2-category breakdown of their carbon offsetting, which is still more than many companies provide in 2022. It allows us to consider energy consumption and offsetting on the same scale and graph.
