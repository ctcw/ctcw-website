# Climate Targets

GlaxoSmithKline has published a number of targets related to carbon emissions. In the first plot we can see that they set a target of Net Zero emissions (where any emissions are offset by carbon capture or storage projects) by 2030 with a reference year of 2017. The target was published in 2020. This target was rated Moderate on Transparency, assessing the level of disclosure for past/present emissions and the level of detail provided about planning to achieve target aims. This target was rated Low on Integrity, an assessment of the target's ambition and appropriateness.

In these graphs the dashed line represents the target's publication date, the target line starts from the reference year.

GSK is another company where the majority of emissions are of scope 3.

GSK have already **updated their targets once**, after initially publishing targets in 2018 these were updated in 2020. In this case they moved from less ambitious targets (2C alignment) to more ambitious targets (1.5C alignment). Based on GHG emissions reporting it looks like they were finding it easier than expected to reduce scope 1 + 2 GHG emissions, or maybe responded to greater than expected pressure over the subsequent years.

This kind of scenario where companies update targets will become increasingly common, and it's one of the reasons why pages dedicated to target tracking as on CTCW should be useful. The above graph just did some tweaking to display two target lines, but there are many options to explore for graphing multiple targets that change and supersede each other over time. If corporate emissions targets end up playing an important role in mitigating climate change, it will be useful to be able to assess how these have changed and how this related to performance indicators over time.

The scope 3 emissions targets were not made any more ambitious in 2020, but this graph suggests that maybe they could have gone harder on reduction targets for scope 3, the same way they have done for scopes 1+2.
