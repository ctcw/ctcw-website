This is the repository for the Climate Target Corporation Watch (CTCW) website, an open source static site presenting research about companies' climate target setting behaviour.

You can check out the research the site is based on in [this repository](https://github.com/ctcw/ctcw-research) (contributors welcome). The raw data is collected through WikiRate projects, so that is an easier on ramp for people who would like to contribute.
